## Project Structure

- `/app` - Contains React Native App codebase
  - `/api` - Api module class. Each file will be feature based like ProductAPI, LoginAPI etc...
  - `/components` - Universal shared containers, components are stand-alone and decoupled.
  - `/config` - Universal styles,images,metrics etc...
  - `/screens` - Feature level containers that holds the entire screen or page 
    - `login`- Login Feature
      - `reducers` - Reducer associated with this feature

      - `selectors` - Selectors associated with the feature
      - `widgets` - Containers associated with the feature that has theme or project scheme 
  - `/lib` - lib helper files
  - `/navigation` - All navigation related stuff including helpers functions and navigation stack

    - `index.js` - Set ups store and export things

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/Toolbone/RNAdvanceArcht.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder, `rm -rf .git`
4. Use [React Native Rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to update project name `$ npx react-native-rename <newName>`
5. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies

6) Start the packager with `npm start`
7) Connect a mobile device to your development machine
8) Run the test application:

- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android`
- On iOS:
  - Open `ios/YourReactProject.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device

9. All set!!!, you are ready to go!
