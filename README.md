## Project Structure

- `/app` - Contains React Native App codebase
  - `/api` - Api module class. Each file will be feature based like ProductAPI, LoginAPI etc...
  - `/components` - Universal shared containers, components are stand-alone and decoupled.
  - `/containers` - Project level containers, like widget associated with project scheme but in a higher level
  - `/config` - Project level styles, images, metrics, strings etc...
  - `/controllers` - This includes centralise error handling mechanism and other Project controllers
  - `/systems` - Project redux elements (actions and reducers), constants, types

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/Toolbone/RNAdvanceArcht.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder, `rm -rf .git`
4. Use [React Native Rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to update project name `$ npx react-native-rename <newName>`
5. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies

6. Start the packager with `npm start`
7. Connect a mobile device to your development machine
8. Run the test application:

- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android`
- On iOS:
  - Open `ios/YourReactProject.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device

9. All set!!!, you are ready to go!

#####Shortcut
1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/Toolbone/RNAdvanceArcht.git <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. yarn install (remember to have Yarn to do this)
4. yarn mock
5. yarn run:ios:debug OR run:android:debug
6. Then You Should be Set!!!

## Troubleshooting
When you face issue with node_module try this steps into your terminal

1. rm -rf node_modules 
2. npm install

If there is an issue with Base 64 and utf8 try
* npm install buffer
 
Unable to resolve module \<module> from `node_modules/ ****`: \<module> could not be found within the project.

If you are sure the module exists, try these steps:
 1. Clear watchman watches: watchman watch-del-all
 2. Delete node_modules: rm -rf node_modules and run yarn install
 3. Reset Metro's cache: yarn start --reset-cache
 4. Remove the cache: rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
 
 If icons not showing properly(only do once)
 * react-native link react-native-vector-icons

To kill process
1. sudo lsof -i :8081
2. kill -9 <PID>

Extra tool commands for gitif you want to push your local files to remote files 
* git push -f \<remote> \<branch>
* git push -f origin master
